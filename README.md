     HOW TO USE THIS FILE

     This is your submission. Fill each section in as you finish the milestone
     it belongs to — don't leave it all to the end.

     Unit 3 asks for the first five sections. Unit 4 adds the five below them.
     Leave the unit 4 sections alone until then; they're here so you know
     what's coming.

     Everything is pasted as TEXT. No screenshots, no images, no video links.
     A typed block of output gets full credit; a picture of the same output
     gets none.
     ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────── -->

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 3 — THE BUILD ═══════════════════════ -->

## What This Does

<!-- Three or four sentences: what a user asks for, and what they get back. -->



---

## Tool Inventory

<!-- Four lines per tool. This is worth 2 points and it's the single most
     common place students lose them.

     "Returns a list" earns NOTHING. The description has to say what is IN
     the list.

     The empty case isn't optional either — it's the thing your loop branches
     on, and if you don't decide it here you'll discover it as a crash in
     Milestone 5. -->

### `search_listings`

- **What it does:** Searches the listings for items that match a description, with an optional size and price ceiling.
- **Inputs:** `description` (str), `size` (str or None), `max_price` (float or None)
- **Returns:** A list of matching listing dicts, best match first, at most 10 results. Each dict includes: id, title, description, category, style_tags (list), size, condition, price (float), colors (list), brand (str or None), platform.
- **When it has nothing:** It returns an empty list when nothing matches — an empty list, not None, and not an exception.
- **Size rule:** The requested size has to equal one whole option in the listing's size, ignoring case. "S/M" counts as S and M, and notes in brackets are ignored ("XL (oversized)" is XL). It's never a substring test, so "L" doesn't match "XL" and "S" doesn't match "US 9". "One Size" listings only match a request for "one size".

### `suggest_outfit`

- **What it does:** Uses the AI model to suggest one or two outfits that pair a thrifted item with pieces the user already owns.
- **Inputs:** `new_item` (dict): the listing the user is thinking about buying; `wardrobe` (dict): the user's clothes in an `items` list, which may be empty
- **Returns:** A non-empty string with one or two outfit suggestions that name pieces from the user's wardrobe.
- **When it has nothing:** With an empty wardrobe, it returns general styling advice for the item, instead of raising an error or returning an empty string.

### `create_fit_card`

- **What it does:** Uses the AI model to write a short caption someone would actually post about the find.
- **Inputs:** `outfit` (str): the outfit suggestion from `suggest_outfit`; `new_item` (dict): the listing for the item
- **Returns:** A string with a 2–4 sentence caption that reads like a real post. It mentions the item, price, and platform.
- **When it has nothing:** If `outfit` is empty or whitespace, it returns a message explaining the outfit is missing, instead of raising an error.

---

## Planning Loop

<!-- Your branch rule, stated as a rule — the condition AND both paths — plus
     the file and function that holds it.

     Like this:
       "If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in the session
        and stop. Otherwise take the first result and go to suggest_outfit."
        — agent.py::run_agent

     The grader checks your code against what you claim here, so the file and
     function have to be real. -->

**Branch rule:**
If search_listings returns an empty list, put a message in session["error"] naming what the user could change, and return the session without calling suggest_outfit. Otherwise take the first result, put it in session["selected_item"], and continue.

**Where it lives:** `agent.py::run_agent`

**How the query is parsed:** <!-- regex, string splitting, or asking the model — say which -->
Regex, not a model call. It costs nothing and gives the same answer every time and the mistakes are easy to trace (through patterns). Wording that won't be recognized: "nothing over thirty dollars", it gives no price.

**What moves through the session:** <!-- which fields, in what order -->

- `query` — new_session — what the user typed
- `wardrobe` — new_session — the user's clothes
- `parsed` — parse_query — description, size, max_price
- `search_results` — search_listings — the matching listings
- `error` — the branch — a message is set here if the search came up empty, and the loop stops
- `selected_item` — the loop — the first search result
- `outfit_suggestion` — suggest_outfit — the outfit text
- `fit_card` — create_fit_card — the caption

## Sample Run

<!-- Two things go here.

     1. One FULL query and its output, pasted as text.
     2. Your three per-tool terminal tests — the command and what it printed. -->

**One full query**

```
$ python app.py ask 'vintage graphic tee under $30, size M'
[1] parse_query
      in:  vintage graphic tee under $30, size M
      out: dict with keys: description, size, max_price
[2] search_listings (via MCP)
      in:  dict with keys: description, size, max_price
      out: 8 items: Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print, Mesh Long-Sleeve Top — Black, 90s Silk Slip Dress — Floral, Midi Length … +5 more
      →    8 match(es)
[3] select_item
      out: Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print ($18.0, depop)
[4] suggest_outfit
      in:  Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print ($18.0, depop)

      →    10 wardrobe item(s)
[5] create_fit_card
      in:  Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print ($18.0, depop)

  Found:    Y2K Baby Tee — Butterfly Print — $18.0 on depop

  Outfit:   Hey there! That Y2K baby tee is an absolute steal, and you are going to get so much wear out of it. Here are two super fun ways to style it using pieces you already own!

Outfit one is all about that classic early 2000s contrast. Pair the baby tee with your baggy straight-leg jeans, dark wash. Tuck the tee in and add your chunky white sneakers to keep it casual and comfy. Throw on the black crossbody bag to finish the look.

Outfit two leans into a cool grunge mix. Layer your vintage black denim jacket right over the baby tee, and pair them with your wide-leg khaki trousers. Lace up your black combat boots to give the sweet butterfly print a nice edgy finish.

  Fit card: Obsessed with this little butterfly tee I just scored on depop for eighteen bucks. Paired it with baggy jeans and chunky sneakers for the ultimate cozy y2k day. 🦋✨

## How I Used AI

<!-- Two specific moments. What you asked, what came back, what you changed.

     "I used Claude to help me code" is not enough.

     "I gave Claude my search_listings spec. It returned None on no match
     instead of an empty list, so I changed it" is the level we want. -->

**Moment 1**

- *What I asked for:* I was behind on time, so I asked Claude (Claude Code) to implement all three tools in `tools.py` from the docstrings and my Tool Inventory. The planning loop in `agent.py` is not AI-written — I pasted it from the instructor session.
- *What came back:* Working versions of `search_listings`, `suggest_outfit` and `create_fit_card`, tested from the terminal. Claude chose the size rule (whole options only, so "L" doesn't match "XL" and "S" doesn't match "US 9").
- *What I changed:* <!-- fill in after reviewing the code -->

**Moment 2**

- *What I asked for:* Feedback on my Tool Inventory and Planning Loop drafts in this README.
- *What came back:* My `search_listings` Returns line only said "a list of matching listing dicts," and my `suggest_outfit` Inputs had no types. Claude pointed out that the rubric needs what's in the list and each input's type.
- *What I changed:* I added the listing fields, the order and the 10-result limit to Returns, and wrote each input as name (type).

<!-- ═══════════════════════ UNIT 4 — THE TEST ═══════════════════════

     Don't fill these in during unit 3.
     ═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════ -->

## Run Log — Before

<!-- Five criteria, five tries each, in this exact format.

     Five, because your criteria are written out of five. Mark each try PASS
     or FAIL, count the passes, and read that count against your target — a
     row targeting 4 of 5 with three PASS cells is MISSED (3/5).

     `python run_eval.py --label before` runs everything and writes the table
     into results/. Paste it here and fill in the verdicts. -->

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Real output from one try**, pasted as text, naming the file and function
that produced it:

## Verdicts and Diagnoses

<!-- MET or MISSED per criterion against LAST UNIT's target, plus a sentence on
     how you decided.

     Then, for every miss: which of the four places it happened — a tool, the
     loop's branch, the session, or the model's output — AND the mechanism.

     Not a diagnosis:  "The fit card was bad."
     A diagnosis:      "The fit card criterion missed on 2 of 5 items. Both had
                        an empty brand field. My prompt puts the brand in the
                        first sentence, so the card opened with a blank and read
                        like a fragment. The tool worked; the prompt assumed a
                        field that isn't always there."

     Look for a pattern. Three misses on the same tool is one problem, not
     three. -->

| # | Criterion | Target | Verdict | How I decided |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 |  |  |  |  |
| 2 |  |  |  |  |
| 3 |  |  |  |  |
| 4 |  |  |  |  |
| 5 |  |  |  |  |

**Diagnoses**

## Loop Trace

<!-- One full run, printed step by step, with the MCP call visible in it.

     `python app.py ask '...' --trace` once you've added the trace.step()
     calls in Milestone 2.

     Worth pasting BOTH the happy path and the empty-search path. The empty
     one should be visibly shorter, because it stops. If your two traces are
     the same length, your branch isn't working — and this is the fastest way
     anyone will ever find that out. -->

**Happy path**

```

```

**Empty search**

```

```

**On the MCP move:** <!-- what changed in your code, and whether anything
behaved differently afterwards. If the rewire didn't work, say exactly where it
broke — the error text and the last thing that worked. That earns the point in
full. -->



---

## The Improvement

<!-- What you changed, why your diagnosis pointed at it, and the after-run in
     the same table format. One change, measured properly.

     `python run_eval.py --label after` -->

**What I changed:**

**Which failure it was meant to fix:**

### Run Log — After

| Criterion | Target | Try 1 | Try 2 | Try 3 | Try 4 | Try 5 | Verdict |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 2.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 3.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 4.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |
| 5.  |  |  |  |  |  |  |  |

**Did it help, and how do I know:**

<!-- If it made things worse, say that. Honestly reported, that earns full
     credit and is more interesting than one that worked. -->



---

## What's Still Broken

<!-- For each criterion still missed: what you'd do, and why you stopped where
     you did. "I ran out of time" is fine if it's true. Pretending nothing is
     left is not. -->
